Launchers are what runs your files so those are required if you want to use Huddu. A Launcher basically is a background task that's running on your application. That means if you have multiple Launchers they are all using the same container.

If you wish to split your application up on multiple containers that means you have to create another application.

There are currently two types of launchers: *launch* and *web*. The *launch* Launcher is used if you want to run an application that does not necessarily display something to the domain like a discord chat bot for example. The second *web* Launcher is used if you want to run an api or a website on Huddu. The only real difference to *launch* Launchers here is that access to your domains is permitted.
